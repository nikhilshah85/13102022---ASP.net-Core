				DI - Dependency Injection 


As a developer - we instantiate lot of objects in our project
	but we never - close the object 
		Write a destructor 
		Clear the references

1. Destroying the objects (objects keeps getting created for new request)
2. Object Reuse - share the object (with same user for multiple request-response)
				   (with the same user for session)
				   (with multiple user)





------------ Framework says, please do not create any object from now onn
	     framework will create the object and destroy the same 
	    Framework will take care of shareing the object


		DI is done in 2 Steps 
		1. Create a new variable of the object you want to use
		   add a constructor and take the reference of object crated by framework
	          assign the object to your variable

		run the app and look at the error, 
		Error - Activation of controller

		2. Framework will create the object with the help of configuration in Program.cs
		There are 3 modes / methods available (to tell framework when to destroy the obj)

		AddTranscient(type) - Per call - new object created for every call, and destroyed 
					after response
		AddScoped(type) - Per Session - new object per session, and destroyed after session 				  is over
		AddSingleTon - 1 global obj - shared by all the user
